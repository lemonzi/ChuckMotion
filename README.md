ChuckMotion
===========

This repo contains a virtual instrument implemented in Chuck meant to be controlled with the Leap Motion.

Right now there is a synth that generates a tone whose partials can be controlled by placing a hand next to the Leap Motion and moving the fingers.

The Leap Motion will be implemented in Go and it's on its way.
